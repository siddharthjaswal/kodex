# Kodex 📚

> *A curated collection of Data Structures & Algorithms solutions in Kotlin*

Welcome to my personal codex of DSA problems! This repository contains solutions to various algorithmic challenges, implemented in Kotlin with detailed explanations, multiple approaches, and insights gained along the journey.

## 🎯 What's Inside

- **Clean Kotlin implementations** of classic DSA problems
- **Detailed comments** explaining the logic and approach
- **Multiple solutions** where applicable (brute force → optimized)
- **Time & Space complexity analysis** for each solution
- **Learning notes** and key insights
- **Problem categorization** for easy navigation

## 📖 Structure

kodex/
├── arrays/
│   ├── two-sum/
│   │   ├── Solution.kt
│   │   └── README.md
│   └── ...
├── linked-lists/
├── trees/
├── graphs/
├── dynamic-programming/
├── sorting/
├── searching/
└── miscellaneous/

Each problem folder contains:
- `Solution.kt` - The main solution(s)
- `README.md` - Problem statement, approach explanation, and complexity analysis

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Browse by category** - Navigate through folders based on data structure or algorithm type
2. **Read the approach** - Each solution includes detailed explanations
3. **Run the code** - All solutions are runnable Kotlin code
4. **Learn from notes** - Check out the insights and alternative approaches

## 🏷️ Problem Categories

- **Arrays & Strings** - Fundamental operations and manipulations
- **Linked Lists** - Traversal, reversal, and complex operations
- **Trees & Binary Search Trees** - Traversals, searching, and modifications
- **Graphs** - BFS, DFS, shortest paths, and more
- **Dynamic Programming** - Optimization problems and memoization
- **Sorting & Searching** - Classic algorithms and their variations
- **Hash Tables** - Efficient lookups and collision handling
- **Stacks & Queues** - LIFO and FIFO operations
- **Miscellaneous** - Unique problems and interesting challenges

## 💡 Learning Philosophy

> "The best way to learn is to solve, understand, and then teach."

Each solution in this kodex follows these principles:
- **Clarity over cleverness** - Readable code that explains itself
- **Progressive complexity** - Start simple, then optimize
- **Real understanding** - Not just working code, but knowing why it works
- **Multiple perspectives** - Different approaches to the same problem
